  <h1>The Problem</h1>
  <p>On 3/14/14, Julie Ann Horvath (@nrrrdcore) announced her decision to leave GitHub. She is the first developer to voluntarily leave the company. Horvath cited years of gendered harassment as a motivating factor in her decision.</p>
  <p>GitHub's internal culture has been widely criticized by STEM feminists for years, though it has made some attempts to improve both its image and its reality - notably through Horvath's Passion Projects speaker series.</p>
  <p>Many have responded to Horvath's account to her treatment by urging people to switch to Bitbucket for their repo hosting. However, this is an imperfect solution. We frankly have no reason to believe that Atlassian's internal culture is any better than GitHub's with regard to diversity. (Indeed, Atlassian's slow response to the C+= fiasco indicates that there are some axes under which they are actively worse than GitHub.) Furthermore, enough organizational workflows are dependent on GitHub specifically that switching will not be a feasible solution for many.</p>

  <h1>Another Solution</h1>
  <p>In the midst of calls to shift projects from GitHub to what could be equally problematic competitors, an alternative idea emerged. Inspired by the concept of carbon offset credits, we are calling for individuals and organizations who rely on GitHub for critical infrastructure to offset the impact of supporting the organization by donating an equal amount of money monthly to one of the many individuals or organizations funded through GitTip who work to counter the institutional injustices so prevalent in the tech community.</p>
