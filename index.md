# The Problem

On 3/14/14, Julie Ann Horvath (@nrrrdcore) announced her decision to leave GitHub. She is the first developer to voluntarily leave the company. Horvath cited years of gendered harassment as a motivating factor in her decision.

GitHub's internal culture has been widely criticized by STEM feminists for years, though it has made some attempts to improve both its image and its reality - notably through Horvath's Passion Projects speaker series.

Many have responded to Horvath's account of her treatment by urging people to switch to Bitbucket for their repo hosting. However, this is an imperfect solution. We frankly have no reason to believe that Atlassian's internal culture is any better than GitHub's with regard to diversity. (Indeed, Atlassian's slow response to the C+= fiasco indicates that there are some axes under which they are actively worse than GitHub.) Furthermore, enough organizational workflows are dependent on GitHub specifically that switching will not be a feasible solution for many.

# Another Solution

In the midst of calls to shift projects from GitHub to what could be equally problematic competitors, an alternative idea emerged. Inspired by the concept of carbon offset credits, we are calling for individuals and organizations who rely on GitHub for critical infrastructure to offset the impact of supporting the organization by donating an equal amount of money monthly to one of the many individuals or organizations funded through GitTip who work to counter the institutional injustices so prevalent in the tech community.

# Organizations

- **[Callback Women](https://www.gittip.com/CallbackWomen/)** works to promote gender diversity at tech conferences, and to support female speakers.
- **[Ada Academy](https://www.gittip.com/adaacademy/)** provides tuition-free programming education for women transitioning into web development.
- **[Refuge Restrooms](https://www.gittip.com/tkwidmer/)** helps transgender, intersex, and gender-nonconforming people find safe, accessible restrooms.
- **[TransH4CK](https://www.gittip.com/TransH4CK/)** supports trans* people in tech, and facilitates tech projects which support trans* people.
- **[Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)** teaches girls of color, ages 7 - 17, to code. They're not on gittip, and therefore technically outside the scope of this project (which is about recurring rather than one-time donations), but we highly encourage one-time donations to them anyway.
- **[LGBTech.org](https://www.gittip.com/LGBTechOrg/)** is an advocacy, education, and outreach organization for LGBTQ* people who work in technology.
- **[The Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/donate-monthly/)** works to support women in open technology and culture.
- **[PHP Women](https://www.gittip.com/PHPWomen/)** is an inclusive and global network providing diversity support within the PHP community.

If you have suggestions for other individuals or organizations that should be on this list, please send an email to [suggestions@cultureoffset.org](mailto:suggestions@cultureoffset.org).
